# Current Source: Ideal and Real

## Overview

This section introduces the concept of current sources, both ideal and real. You will learn how a real current source behaves differently from an ideal one, especially when changing the load resistance in a circuit.

## Mini Project

**Goal:**  
Simulate and compare the behavior of an ideal and a real current source in a simple circuit with a resistor.

**Steps:**

1. Draw two circuits in ICircuits (or use another simulator if needed):
    - Circuit 1: Ideal current source in series with a resistor.
    - Circuit 2: Real current source â€” model this as a voltage source with a large series resistor, in series with a load resistor.
2. Run the simulation for both circuits.
3. Vary the load resistor in both circuits and observe the current through and voltage across the load.
4. Take screenshots of your circuits and results.

**Deliverables:**
- Schematics (images or circuit files)
- Short written explanation:
    - How does the current through the load change in each case as you change the resistor value?
    - What differences do you notice between the ideal and real current sources?
    - Any observations or questions after your experiment
