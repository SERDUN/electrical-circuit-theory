# Resistor, Capacitor, Inductor

## Overview

This section explores the three fundamental passive components of electrical circuits: resistors, capacitors, and inductors. You will learn how each component behaves in a simple DC circuit and how they influence current and voltage.

## Mini Project

**Goal:**  
Simulate separate circuits with a resistor, a capacitor, and an inductor, and observe their behavior when connected to a DC voltage source.

**Steps:**

1. Draw three separate circuits in ICircuits:
    - Circuit 1: Battery and resistor in series
    - Circuit 2: Battery and capacitor in series
    - Circuit 3: Battery and inductor in series (if available in the app)
2. For each circuit, run the simulation and observe:
    - Current through the component
    - Voltage across the component
    - Any changes over time (especially for the capacitor and inductor)
3. Take screenshots of your circuits and the simulation results.
4. Compare the behaviors of all three components in your notes.

**Deliverables:**
- Schematics (images or ICircuits files)
- Short written explanation:
    - How does each component behave when the circuit is powered on?
    - What differences do you notice between resistor, capacitor, and inductor?
    - Any interesting observations or questions during the experiment
