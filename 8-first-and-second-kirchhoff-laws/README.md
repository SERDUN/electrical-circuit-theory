# First and Second Kirchhoff's Laws

## Overview

This section introduces Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL) and Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL), fundamental rules for analyzing electric circuits. You will learn how to apply these laws to determine currents and voltages in complex circuits.

## Mini Project

**Goal:**  
Apply Kirchhoff’s Laws to analyze a circuit with multiple loops and nodes.

**Steps:**

1. Draw a circuit in ICircuits with at least two loops and three nodes, including resistors and voltage sources.
2. Identify all nodes and loops.
3. Write down the system of equations using:
   - Kirchhoff’s Current Law for each node
   - Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law for each loop
4. Solve the equations manually or using software.
5. Simulate the circuit in ICircuits and compare simulation results with your calculations.
6. Take screenshots of the circuit and simulation results.

**Deliverables:**
- Circuit schematic
- System of Kirchhoff’s equations
- Solution of equations
- Comparison and analysis of simulation vs calculations
- Short reflection: challenges and insights
