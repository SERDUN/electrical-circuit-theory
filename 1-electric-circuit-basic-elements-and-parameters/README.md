# Electric Circuit: Basic Elements and Parameters

## Overview

This section covers the fundamentals of electric circuits: what a circuit is, its main components (such as power source, wires, and loads), and the key parameters that describe circuit behavior.

## Mini Project

**Goal:**  
Build a simple electric circuit simulation that consists of a power source (battery), a resistor, and a switch. Observe and describe how current flows through the circuit when the switch is open and closed.

**Steps:**

1. Draw the schematic of your circuit using ICircuits.
2. Place and connect the following elements:
    - Battery (voltage source)
    - Resistor
    - Switch (in series with the resistor)
3. Run the simulation.
4. Observe how the current changes when you open/close the switch.
5. Take a screenshot of your schematic and simulation results.

**Deliverables:**
- Schematic (image or ICircuits file)
- Short written explanation:
    - What happens to the current and voltage across the resistor when the switch is open vs closed?
    - Any insights or questions after the experiment
