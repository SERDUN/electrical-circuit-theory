# Steady-State and Transient Modes of Electric Circuits

## Overview

This section covers the difference between steady-state and transient modes in electric circuits. You will learn how circuits behave immediately after switching and after they stabilize over time, especially in circuits with capacitors and inductors.

## Mini Project

**Goal:**  
Simulate the charging and discharging behavior of a capacitor in an RC circuit and observe the transient and steady-state responses.

**Steps:**

1. Create an RC circuit in ICircuits consisting of:
    - A voltage source (battery)
    - A resistor
    - A capacitor
2. Run the simulation and observe the voltage across the capacitor over time as it charges.
3. Open or close a switch to simulate charging and discharging.
4. Take screenshots or record the voltage vs time graph.
5. Repeat with different resistor or capacitor values to see how the transient response changes.
6. Write a short explanation comparing transient and steady-state behavior.

**Deliverables:**
- Circuit schematic and screenshots
- Explanation of transient charging and steady-state voltage
- Observations on how component values affect the transient response
