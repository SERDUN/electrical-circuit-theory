# Electric Current: Current Strength, Speed, and Direction

## Overview

This section introduces the concept of electric current, how its strength is measured, and discusses the speed and direction of current flow in a circuit. You will learn the difference between conventional current direction and actual electron flow.

## Mini Project

**Goal:**  
Simulate a simple circuit to measure current and visualize how current changes with different resistor values. Explore the direction of current in your simulation.

**Steps:**

1. Draw a circuit in ICircuits using:
    - Battery (voltage source)
    - Resistor
    - Ammeter (or enable current measurement if available)
2. Run the simulation and measure the current through the resistor.
3. Change the resistor value and observe how the current changes.
4. Check and note the direction of current as shown in the simulation (compare to conventional current direction).
5. Take screenshots of your circuit and results.

**Deliverables:**
- Schematic (image or ICircuits file)
- Short written explanation:
    - How does current change when you use a larger/smaller resistor?
    - Which direction does the simulation show the current flowing?
    - What is the difference between conventional current direction and electron flow?
