# Voltage Source: Ideal and Real

## Overview

This section explains the concept of an ideal voltage source versus a real voltage source. You will learn how internal resistance affects the behavior of real sources and how this influences voltage and current in a circuit.

## Mini Project

**Goal:**  
Simulate and compare the behavior of an ideal and a real voltage source in a simple circuit with a resistor.

**Steps:**

1. Draw two circuits in ICircuits:
    - Circuit 1: Battery (as an ideal voltage source) in series with a resistor.
    - Circuit 2: Battery in series with a small resistor (to represent internal resistance), then a load resistor.
2. Run the simulation for both circuits.
3. Observe and record the voltage across the load resistor and the current in each circuit.
4. Change the value of the load resistor and observe how the voltage and current change in each setup.
5. Take screenshots of your circuits and results.

**Deliverables:**
- Schematics (images or ICircuits files)
- Short written explanation:
    - What differences do you observe between the ideal and real voltage sources?
    - How does internal resistance affect the circuitâ€™s voltage and current?
    - Any conclusions or questions from your experiment
