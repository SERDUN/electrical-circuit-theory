# Electric Circuit: Node, Branch, Loop

## Overview

This section explains the key structural concepts of electric circuits: node, branch, and loop. You will learn how to identify these elements in a circuit and understand their importance for circuit analysis.

## Mini Project

**Goal:**  
Draw a circuit, identify all nodes, branches, and loops, and practice labeling them correctly.

**Steps:**

1. Create a circuit in ICircuits with at least two power sources and three resistors connected in a way that forms multiple loops.
2. Print or export the schematic, or take a clear screenshot.
3. On the schematic (either digitally or on paper), clearly label:
    - All **nodes** (junction points where elements connect)
    - All **branches** (sections between nodes)
    - At least two different **loops** (closed paths in the circuit)
4. Optionally, create a simple test or quiz: ask yourself to identify nodes, branches, and loops in different configurations.

**Deliverables:**
- Labeled schematic (image or ICircuits file with clear annotations)
- Short written explanation:
    - How did you identify each node, branch, and loop?
    - Why is it important to distinguish between these elements in circuit analysis?
    - Any questions or confusions you encountered during the task
