# Ohm's Law: Three Forms of Representation

## Overview

This section covers Ohm's Law, a fundamental principle that relates voltage, current, and resistance in an electric circuit. You will study the three common algebraic forms of Ohm’s Law and how to use them for calculations.

## Mini Project

**Goal:**  
Practice applying the three forms of Ohm’s Law in simple circuit calculations and verify the results through simulation.

**Steps:**

1. Write down the three forms of Ohm’s Law:
    - \( V = I \times R \)
    - \( I = \frac{V}{R} \)
    - \( R = \frac{V}{I} \)
2. Choose at least two different resistor values and a voltage source.
3. Calculate the missing quantity (voltage, current, or resistance) using the appropriate formula.
4. Simulate the circuit in ICircuits with the chosen values.
5. Compare the simulation results with your calculations.
6. Take screenshots of your circuits and simulation results.

**Deliverables:**
- Calculations for chosen values
- Schematics and screenshots from the simulation
- Short written explanation:
    - How did the simulation results compare to your calculations?
    - Any insights or difficulties in applying Ohm’s Law in different forms
